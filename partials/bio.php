<h1>Biography</h1>

<p>Hello and welcome to MCplusMusic! My name is Lena Oks and I’m originally from Odessa, a beautiful city-port in Ukraine.</p>

<p>I have been a professional musician/singer/song writer for over 16 years and a gold medalist from both music school and The Music Conservatory. My formal, extensive training included: vocal coaching, composing, orchestra conducting, instrumental leadership and youth choruses and community music groups.</p>

<p>I have been fortunate to attend performances and events with my own select group of young talent. Our troupe traveled along with dance groups and solo performers all over the country and the world. It has been so rewarding to work with young people with exceptional talent as well as to have build associations with local Children’s Musical Theatre and be a member of a well known band “Accord” both as a singer and MC. My love of music and dedication to the craft has enriched my career and I have been blessed to share my success with some amazing people in this industry.</p>

<p>Now in America I continue my career as a musician and entertainer. I provide MC services for weddings, anniversaries, baby/bridal showers, corporate events and celebrations.</p>

<p>My goal is to provide a memorable, one of a kind event that will always feel special. I’ve designed a unique approach for my clients and offer a step-by step guide to personalize the occasion and make it truly “Yours”. Along with hosting and MC services, life music entertainment is provided and clients can request from 2-4 additional musicians. There are over 500 songs to choose from and the music list includes both American and International selections.</p>
